# Document-Web-Attack-Detection
## Project:
The goal of this project is to use DVWA as a vulnerable website to simulate web-based attacks, and then perform endpoint detection and response. In this lab, I will be using Wazuh as an EDR solution and Suricata as an IDS/IPS. The Wazuh server will be hosted on an Ubuntu machine, while the Wazuh agent will be installed on a Kali Linux machine, which also contains DVWA as a target.
